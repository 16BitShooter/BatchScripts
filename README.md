# BatchScripts
This is my First Repo on GitHub, so please give me a break if I did something wrong.
This specific Repo is a Simple Batch File that will make life easier.
This combined with IW4M-Admin (https://github.com/RaidMax/IW4M-Admin) will give your Call of Duty server a professional look.
 
 # Installation
  First you will need to download IW4M-Admin (https://github.com/RaidMax/IW4M-Admin) and configure it to your likeing.
  You will also need a Call of Duty server to put all of this stuff in, I'm going to use Plutonium for example. 
  
  Once you have IW4M-Admin Configured how you want it, drag and drop my batch file into the folder with IW4M-Admin.
  Please be sure IW4M-Admin is working properly with your server before proceeding.
  
  Navigate to your server foler, where your server files and such are. 
  Then copy everything from your IW4M-Admin into the folder your server resides in.
  
  Once you do that, Find the DualLaunch.bat and launch it.
  If everything goes smoothly you should end up with a Call of Duty server running in another window, and IW4M-Admin running in the first cmd that opened up.
